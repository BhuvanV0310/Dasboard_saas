# CSV UI Polish Checklist

A checklist of visual and interaction polish items applied across the CSV Analytics UI.

## Spacing & Typography
- Consistent `p-6` paddings for cards and tables.
- Headings: `text-xl` for section titles, `text-3xl` for page headers.
- Subtext uses muted gray for visual hierarchy.

## Colors & Themes
- Gradient cards for key metrics (blue/green/purple).
- High-contrast chart option toggled from AI card.
- Light backgrounds with subtle shadows for elevated surfaces.

## Interactions
- Subtle motion on component mount via Framer Motion.
- Hover states for links and buttons with smooth transitions.
- Upload progress with animated progress bar.

## Accessibility
- ARIA roles and labels for charts, tables, and progressbars.
- AI Insights region uses `aria-live` for polite updates.
- Form controls (file input, checkbox) labeled and keyboard friendly.

## Resilience
- Toasts for errors and successes across upload, analytics, and AI.
- Skeleton loaders to avoid layout shift and perceived delays.
- Timeouts for long-running operations with clear messaging.

## Navigation & Metadata
- Sidebar includes "CSV Uploads" entry (admin-only).
- Pages export `metadata.title` for basic SEO and discoverability.

## Future Enhancements
- Persist chart settings per user.
- Theming (dark mode, system preference).
- Prefetch analytics for recently uploaded files.
